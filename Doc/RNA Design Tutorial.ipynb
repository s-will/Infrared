    "**Remark:** At this point, we have implemented the full functionality of the RNA design approach IncaRNAtion (Reinharz et al., Bioinformatics 2013) in Infrared. In Infrared, we can easily extend the model further by including further constraints and going on to multi-target design. Infrared makes the latter, which extends functionality to the tool RNARedPrint (Hammer et al; BMC Bioinf 2021), look surprisingly simple. (We demonstrate this in a separate accompanying notebook, as well as in the Infrared-based application RNARedPrint 2)."
